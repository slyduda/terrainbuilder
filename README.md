Terrain Builder
===============

This is a library to simulate plate tectonics.
This library is written entirely in Python to make Terrain Generation more beginner friendly rather than relying on a C implemation.
As Python is much slower since it is interpreted rather than compiled, this package trades efficiency with learnability.

This project is derivative of the C++ implemation of [PlateTectonics](https://github.com/Mindwerks/plate-tectonics)

How can I use it?
=================

As of right now the project is unusable, but after testing and further development it will work out of the box.
